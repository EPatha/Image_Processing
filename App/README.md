## **Features**

1. **Image Compression**
   - Reduces the size of images while maintaining acceptable quality levels.
   - Allows users to choose compression quality percentages.

2. **File Uploading**
   - Supports uploading and processing of various image formats.

3. **Grayscale Conversion**
   - Converts images from color to grayscale for simplicity and analysis.

4. **Histogram Analysis**
   - Visualizes the intensity distribution of pixel values.

5. **Comparison of Image Size**
   - Provides side-by-side comparisons of original and compressed image sizes.

## **Algorithms Used**

- **Compression Algorithms**: Implemented techniques to achieve lossy or lossless compression.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Standard algorithms for RGB to grayscale transformation.
- **Histogram Generation**: Calculation of frequency distribution for pixel intensities.

## **Image Quality Metrics**

1. **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**
   - Measures the similarity between the original and processed images.

2. **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**
   - Indicates the ratio of maximum signal power to noise power.

3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - Calculates the average squared difference between pixel intensities.

4. **Entropy**
   - Evaluates the information content or randomness in the image.

5. **Unified Average Change in Intensity (UACI)**
   - Measures the average intensity variation between images.
